# My Personal Portfolio

Personal Portfolio Web-app Built with React/Nextjs, Scss on the Frontend && Sanity on the Backend.

## Description

Two problems faced me with my old Portfolio:

1- It was a little boring and not so so modren looking

2- It was a real pain to update the sections since i had to hard code every change i needed to make, So my motivation building this project was solving these two problems.

Hence i tried my best making to create something that:

1-Looks modren and include some animations to keep the audience engaged and more willing to keep scrolling.

2-Easy to update to provide a good owner experience (In this case the owner is me personally :D).

## Features

1- Modern aesthetics, animations and Responsivness to most screen sizes.

2- Used Sanity Api Service for easy real time section updates and product felixability.

3- Images are lazy loaded for better performance.
